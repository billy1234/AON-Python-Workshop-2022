# Lesson 2


## Functions

In Python to make a reusable sections of code you can define [Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions).

These are a great way to package up reusable code. Typicaly a function will take parameters and can return a value.


## Data Types

Python has some built in [Data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html). Its important to understand the difference between these types.


Some of the more simple types are: **Booleans**, **Integers**, **Floats** and **Strings**.

When you declare a variable you can actually specify the type of the vairable. This will help gaurd against confusing its type.

`text_var : str = 'hello world'`

## Collections

Typically we want to group lots of primative datatypes together. To do this we use collections, the three most fundamental collections are:

* [Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) - Ordered, starts from 0 - N 

* [Sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets) - Unorderd, supports [Set operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#:~:text=Basic%20operations%5Bedit%5D).

* [Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) - Unorderd, Maps from any value to any value.
