# Lesson 4

## Objects

Python is Object Oriented, Objects are a type of variable that compose other variables, They are a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.

A Class is the deffintion of an Object, where as an "Object" is that instance in memory.

To declare a class in python you use the `class` keyword.

    class ClassName:

        class_variable = 7

        def __init__(self):
            #Initalize the class here

        def a_function(self,x):
            #Heres a function for the class


Then to create an `instance` of this class you call its contructor.

`x = ClassName()`
