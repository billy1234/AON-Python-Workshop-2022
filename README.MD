# Python Workshop
This project is a set of lessons for AONs 2022 Python Workshop.
All code examples are here.

## Tools/Software needed

This project is intended to be run on Windows machines. However nothing here is windows specific besides powershell.

* [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell) (One of the inbult windows terminals, No installation needed)
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (All code will be written in Python3)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (A Free Opensource IDE for developing python code)

The easiety way to install Python on Windows is to first install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) Then use it to install Python.

Once Chocolatey is installed simply type:

        choco install python 
        
Into powershell (_make sure you restart your Powershell after installing Chocolatey_).
